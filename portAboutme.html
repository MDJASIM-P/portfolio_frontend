            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> My name is Muhammed Jasim P, I’ve been studying Master's in Computer Application for six months. In order to kick-start my career before I
                    masters, I am looking for a job of a web developer, since that’s what I’ve been doing already for one year in my
                    free time. Designing websites for friends, developing simple e-shops with the help of some open source
                    content-management systems, and so on. </li>
                    <li>Besides that I am a normal guy who enjoys hiking and spending time with
                    friends, while not working or studying, which takes most of my time of course. If I should pick the best website
                    I’ve designed up to this point, it will be this one: [name of the website]. I am ambitious and hard-working and
                    believe you’ll give me a chance to prove my words.
                    </li>
                <li>I am  also a versatile web designer due to my extensive history in web design. My dedication to
                    continuously learning about new web design trends and concepts has made me a valuable member of the team. With
                    one year of experience and a master's in Computer Application, My expertise can help customers modernize with
                    websites and appeal to expanding customer populations.
                 </li>
